# ACPF_Ontario
The Agricultural Conservation Planning Framework (ACPF) is a watershed-scale decision-support system developed by the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to identify opportunities for implementing Best Management Practices (BMPs) in agricultural landscapes.

This repository provides automation scripts and workflows designed to prepare ACPF-compatible input datasets for southern Ontario watersheds using annual crop inventory data, and other geospatial data from the Ontario GeoHub. Building on this automation process, the Ontario Government has prepared and published ACPF-ready input datasets that practitioners, researchers, and watershed coordinators can directly use to identify and prioritize targeted BMPs for specific watersheds across the province.
